This repository contains the source files for my website, https://www.leonshpaner.com.

This is a portfolio website of my work as both student and teacher and can also be viewed at https://lshpaner.rbind.io

Here, I leverage the [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) theme of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework, "one of the most popular open-source static site generators" and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to construct and regularly deploy a swift and secure site from [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files pushed to this repository. 

For being helpful in this endeavor, I would like to thank [@apreshil](https://github.com/apreshill) and [@gcushen](https://github.com/gcushen) for providing exceptional resources.
