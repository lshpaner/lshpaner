<p>The following visualization shows county by county numbers (quantity) of emergency service providers for COVID-19 related endeavors. Herein, it is interesting to note that Los Angeles and Orange Counties have the highest number of said providers with a total of 1,025 and 388 respectively. Whatâ€™s more is that some counties are missing entirely from the map as there either exists no data for those areas, or they are physically lacking in resources.</p>
