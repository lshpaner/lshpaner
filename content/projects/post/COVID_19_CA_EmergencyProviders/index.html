<p>The following visualization shows county by county numbers (quantity) of emergency service providers for COVID-19 related endeavors. This data was sourced independently from the ArcGIS Hub open data and linked directly to Tableau using <a href="https://leonshpaner.com/datasets/covid_19_data/EmergencyServiceProvidersinCA/COVID19EmergProvCA.js">Javascript</a> and html to produce this <a href="https://leonshpaner.com/datasets/covid_19_data/EmergencyServiceProvidersinCA/COVID19EmergProvCA.html">web data connector</a> whose button is clickable within the Tableau environment.</p>
<p>More importantly, it is interesting to note that Los Angeles and Orange Counties have the highest number of said providers with a total of 1,025 and 388 respectively. Whatâ€™s more is that some counties are missing entirely from the map as there either exists no data for those areas, or they are physically lacking in resources.</p>
