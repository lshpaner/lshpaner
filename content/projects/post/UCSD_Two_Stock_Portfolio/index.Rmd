> PORTFOLIOS: Return & Risk via Finance & Excel
> Complete the following tasks (based on the principles shown in the text book, instructor learning materials as well your own prior course work):
>
> Calculate the expected returns, standard deviations and coefficient of variations of a two-stock portfolio. We have the following data for Stock 'C' and Stock 'S'.

> In sum, your tasks are to calculate Expected Return, Standard Deviation and Coefficient of Variation for each of these scenarios using your own Excel model. 
>
> For extra-credit, graph your calculated results. ðŸ˜ƒ
>
> The learning goals from this assignment are:
> Develop competency in calculating expected return and risk metrics for a multi-asset portfolio [in this instance and for exercise purposes, a two-asset portfolio].
